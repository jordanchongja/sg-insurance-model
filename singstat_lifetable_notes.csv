The methodology for constructing complete life tables for the Singapore resident population is presented in the Singapore Department of Statistics’ Information Paper “Complete Life Tables 2003 – 2006 for Singapore Resident Population”  which can also be found in the weblink below.

Preliminary death rates for 2024 are derived based on the average number of deaths and mid-year population in 2023 and 2024.
"Life expectancy data for 2020 to 2023 have been affected by higher mortality rates, particularly those observed in 2021 and 2022, arising from the COVID-19 pandemic.  As these higher mortality rates are assumed to apply throughout a lifetime, life expectancy data for 2020 to 2023 may not accurately represent the number of years individuals can expect to live, if mortality rates return to pre-pandemic levels"
